February 14th (7:15 - 7:30):
  - Discussed with TA our current progress on what we talked about last week.
  - Looked into the Music Visualizer API, uses JavaScript for basic visual components
  - Recommended that we look deeper into the Spotify API as our entire website depends on it.

  -Spoke with the TA via email instead of actually meeting.
 
February 28th (7:15 - 7:30):
  - Look into how the music will be visualized and what data we are getting from Spotify to translate to that visualization
  - How will the music visualization be made custom (something to seperate us from the others)
  - What data are we getting from the API
  - Look into other different types of visualizations (maybe something cooler than just a typical bar graph)
  - Create Readme and start thr frontend UI of the website
